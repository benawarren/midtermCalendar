# midtermCalendar

This was my midterm project for a high school CS Seminar class, as well as the template upon which the calendar feature of the [Cortex](https://github.com/Acemcshlaghg/Cortex)
app was based. That feature was my primary contribution (along with brainstorming and feature-building throughout the process) to the project.

It is a fairly simple IOS app written using Swift (and UIKit) in the XCode IDE.
